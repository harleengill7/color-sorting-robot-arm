# color-sorting-robot-arm
The purpose of this project is to design a robotic arm that can organize objects by color by implementing topics we covered in class. This is a hands on approach to understand the material that we learned in the ECE 3641 course. We used the Braccio robot arm, Arduino Uno, TCS 3200 Color Sensor, and Qt creator for programming.
